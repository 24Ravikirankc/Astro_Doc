<p>Research plays a vital role in technical documentation. Below are the key areas that I focus on as part of my research on a topic.<p>

<h3>Online search</h3>
<p>I use the relevant keywords to search for information related to a topic. I explore online communities and scholarly resources to understand concepts related to a topic. It has become an integral part of our daily lives. I trust it is a powerful tool that enables us to explore, learn, and stay informed in this digital era.</p>
<h3>Jira user stories</h3>
<p>These stories provide a glimpse into the functioning of a feature. This basic understanding sets the foundation for productive discussions with one and all in the team and paves the way for comprehensive, clear, and timely documentation.
It helps teams prioritize tasks, understand user needs, and focus on delivering value quickly and effectively.</p>
<h3>Demo recordings</h3>
<p>Customers commonly use it as a visual demonstration of how a product works and what benefits it offers.
Walkthroughs provided by the SMEs to the product managers and the senior management helps answer the key questions such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the purpose of the new feature?</li>
<li>What challenges are being solved through the feature for the clients?</li>
<li>Notes, Warnings, and Tips.</li>
</ol>
<h2>SME interaction</h2>
<p>Interacting with SMEs further helps plan the topics and address the gaps between the theoretical concepts and real-world implementation of the new feature. I understand the existing limitations, bugs, and edge cases where the feature under test behaves differently from the expected behavior. By reviewing an existing document, an organization can mitigate risk, ensure compliance with regulations, and make informed decisions based on accurate and varied information.</p>
