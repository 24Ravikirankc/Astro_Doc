User-centric/focused documentation helps your customer understand the software’s workflow and allows them to locate what they need within your documentation structures. Below are the key areas I focus on as part of my technical documentation building.

### Becoming the first user of software and technical documents
I become the “first customer, and I go through the software/process I describe by myself. I figure out how many potential issues and questions are. This will help me place myself in the reader’s mind and know where to put content in the documentation structure so it appears correctly.

### Reflecting proper UI terminology in technical documents
I use the same UI terminology and process flow that helps customers to search for help. Customers immediately draw parallels and experience them effectively by using the same UI terminology.

>**Note:** UI – User Interface, which is a display screen of software.
