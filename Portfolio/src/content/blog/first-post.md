<!-- # En Dash and Em Dash -->

I have been working as a technical editor and writer for technical documentation for several years. I often use **En dash** and **Em dash** in documents, and needed clarification about their usage. This guide may help when you are editing or writing documents using En Dash and Em Dash.

---

## En Dash (–)

The **En Dash** is used to describe an inclusive range of numbers more accurately. Always use the 'minus sign' as the En Dash.

### Usage:
1. To indicate a range of numbers such as inclusive values, dates, or pages.  
   **Examples**:  
   - 1993–1994  
   - Pages 95–110  
   - 6–8 AM

2. To replace a hyphen in compound adjectives to join a hyphenated compound to another word.  
   **Example**:  
   - Dialog box–type options  

3. In other contexts, such as with scores and directions.  
   **Example**:  
   - The Mysore–Bangalore train leaves at two o’clock.

## Em Dash (—)

The **Em Dash** is longer than the En Dash in size. It is used to:  
- Set off an introductory noun, or a series of nouns, from a pronoun that refers back to them and introduces the main clause.

### Usage:
1. Instead of a colon or semicolon, use Em Dash.  
   **Examples**:  
   - Shashi needs three things at the store—butter, milk, and bread.  
   - Shashi needs three things at the store: butter, milk, and bread. _(Without Em Dash)_

2. Instead of commas and parentheses, use Em Dash.  
   **Examples**:  
   - I talked to Mr. Padmanabhan—CEO of The ABC, IT Company—at the Seminar Hall, SIT College Auditorium.  
   - I talked to Mr. Padmanabhan (CEO of The ABC, IT Company) at the Seminar Hall, SIT College Auditorium. _(Without Em Dash)_
